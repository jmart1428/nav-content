# How to: Batch Post Output and Run Times
The output quantity represents the work progress in the form of the finished quantity.  

> [!NOTE]
> Only when you post output quantity on the last operation, the inventory is updated automatically.  

## To post output quantities for one or more production order lines
1. Choose the ![Search for Page or Report](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Search for Page or Report icon") icon, enter **Output Journal**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Fill in the fields with the production order data and the output data. [!INCLUDE[tooltip-inline-tip](includes/tooltip-inline-tip_md.md)]
3. If the operation has been completed, select the **Finished** field.  

    If the warehouse location where the items should be put away uses bins but does not require put-away processing,  assign a bin code to the journal line to specify where the items should be placed in the warehouse. For more information, see [How to: Put Away Production or Assembly Output](warehouse-how-to-put-away-production-output.md).  

4. Choose the **Post** acto post the operations. The output quantity will be posted. The item is now available for shipping.  

## To post run times for one or more production order lines
The run time represents work progress in the form of the necessary working time.    

1.  Choose the ![Search for Page or Report](media/ui-search/search_small.png "Search for Page or Report icon") icon, enter **Output Journal**, and then choose the related link.  
2. Fill in the fields with the production order data and the output data.  
3.  If the operation is completed, select the **Finished** field.  
4. Choose the **Post** action to post the time spent per operation. Capacity ledger entries are updated for the used work or machine centers.
